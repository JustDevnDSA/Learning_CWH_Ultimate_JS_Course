Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses Four pillars of OOPs to create efficient software systems: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These four pillars provide the foundation for writing maintainable and scalable code

Encapsulation --> Hiding the details
Abstraction ----> Using stuffs and combine them to make a one
Inheritence ---> Modifying the exixting one to newer version
Polymorphism ---> Sinle things but used in multiple ways
